# QuizWebApp
A user-friendly quiz application for programming learners with registration, login, and admin management functionality.

## Overview

This project is a **Quiz Webapp** designed to help programming learners assess their knowledge and improve their skills. It allows users to register, log in, take quizzes with customizable difficulty levels, and view their results. Admins have full control over users, quizzes, and results through a simple dashboard. This web application uses **Java**, **Servlets**, **JSP**, and **MySQL** for storage.

### Features
- **User Registration and Login**: Simple and user-friendly sign-up/login for users.
- **Quiz Dashboard**: Users can choose difficulty levels and number of questions.
- **Randomized Questions**: Randomly generated questions that don't repeat during a quiz.
- **Result Display**: After completion, users can view their results.
- **Logout**: Option to log out after quiz completion.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Admins can view user activity and manage:
  - **Users** (CRUD operations)
  - **Questions** (CRUD operations)
  - **Quiz Sections** (CRUD operations)
  - **Quiz Results** (CRUD operations)
- **Session Management**: Ensures users are properly authenticated before accessing certain pages.

### Why This Project?

We created this project to help programming learners improve their skills through self-assessment quizzes. The main problems we aim to solve are:
- Making it easy for learners to test their knowledge on programming topics.
- Providing a seamless and intuitive user experience for both learners and admins.

### Why Java?

Java is used in this project because it is fast, smooth, and safe, making it ideal for large-scale web applications. The security features of Java, combined with the benefits of **Servlets** and **JSP**, ensure reliable and robust performance.
